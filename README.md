# Laravel Backend Development Repository

Welcome to my **Laravel Backend Development** repository! This repository contains all of my projects, exercises, and experiments related to backend development using the **Laravel framework**.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository, named **Backend Development**, contains all my backend-related projects. It includes multiple folders such as **TP_01**, **TP_02**, **TP_03**, and so on. Each folder represents a standalone project focused on a specific backend topic, concept, or technology.

Each TP folder includes:

* A complete backend project
* Documentation (if provided)
* Source code and structure specific to the technology used

## 📚 Documentation Conversion

One of the goals of this repository is to **convert every part of my backend development documentation into a complete and well-organized format**. This includes:

* Detailed explanations of each project
* Step-by-step setup guides
* APIs and route documentation
* Database structures and diagrams
* Code architecture and design patterns
* Laravel best practices

All documentation will be progressively improved and expanded to provide a clear reference for learning and future development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Each project may use **different backend technologies** depending on the topic. Technologies included across the repository may vary from one project to another, such as:

### Databases

* **MySQL**
* **MariaDB**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **MongoDB**
* **Neo4j** (graph database)

### Backend Framework

* **Laravel** (primary framework used)

### Other Tools

* Composer
* PHP 8+
* ORMs and query builders depending on the project

Each TP folder specifies clearly which technology is used.

## 🚀 Goals

* Build a strong backend foundation using Laravel
* Learn and apply best practices
* Document all important backend concepts clearly
* Create professional and reusable Laravel project structures

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project will typically include:

* `/app` — Main application logic
* `/routes` — Application routes
* `/database` — Migrations and seeders
* `/resources` — Views and templates (if any)
* `/docs` — Project-specific documentation
